The Project is aim to learn how to use the iot module by Tuya. The Project is to read the temperature and the humidity from the sht30, and show it on the OLED screen and upload it to the tuya cloud. 
# Introduce
* get the temperature and the humidity information from the SHT30 sensor on board
* show the information on the 0.96" OLED screen
* upload the information to the tuya cloud that I can see the temperature and the humidity in tuya APP.
