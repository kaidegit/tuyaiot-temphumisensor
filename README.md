This project is developed using Tuya SDK, which enables you to quickly develop branded apps connecting and controlling smart scenarios of many devices. For more information, please check [Tuya Developer Website](https://iot.tuya.com).

# Introduce
* get the temperature and the humidity information from the SHT30 sensor on board
* show the information on the 0.96" OLED screen
* upload the information to the tuya cloud that I can see the temperature and the humidity in tuya APP.

# Software
MCU SDK by Tuya

STM32 CubeMX with HAL

Source Code is in the "source" folder

# Todo
This is the first board to use the Tuya module. And it actually expose some problems.
* the LDO is too hot to influence the temperature sensor, maybe 2 or 3 degrees.
* The MCU is a little expensive. Although I buy it(STM32G031CBT6) for only about 10RMB, it is inappropriate to use a high performance MCU to do such a little thing.
* The fixing way of the OLED, using female header and male pin, is unreliable. 
* The USB2TTL chip CH340 and the flash chip may unused.
